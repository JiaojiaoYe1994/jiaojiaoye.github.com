![Profil](imgs/profil.jpg)


I'm currently pursuing my master degree at Eletrical and Computer Engineering Department, Technical University of Munich, Germany. At the same time, now I'm doing a Internship about Perception based on GAN technique at Robert Bosch GmbH.

Before this, 2016 I got my Bachelor of Engineer at Zhejiang University in China. Through different lectures and projects, I have obtained the chance to be exposed to the field of artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis and computer vision. I am particularly keen to do some research on the application of artificial intelligence, especially the combination of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

### Tutorial
* **CS231n's Assignments** 

I've worked througn Stanford's Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu), which is a wonderful lecture for diving into Deep Learning. [Here](https://github.com/JiaojiaoYe1994/cs231_assignment_solution1718) find out my solution for assignments.


### Publications
* A Generative Map for Image-based Camera Localization. Mingpan Guo, Stefan Matthes, Jiaojiao Ye and Hao Shen, 2019, under review
