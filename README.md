## Welcome to JiaojiaoYe Pages




![Profil](imgs/profil.jpg | width=200)


I'm currently pursuing my master degree at Eletrical and Computer Engineering Department, Technical University of Munich, Germany. At the same time, now I'm doing a Internship about vision-based Perception with GAN technique for L5 autonomous driving at Robert Bosch GmbH.

Before this, 2016 I got my Bachelor of Engineer at Zhejiang University in China. Through different lectures and projects, I have obtained the chance to be exposed to the field of artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis and computer vision. 

I am now a part of the AI research Lab at Volkswagen Data Lab, working on Conditional VAE and Probabilistic Movement Primitives on Human-Robot-Interaction. 

I am particularly keen to do some research on the application of artificial intelligence, especially the combination of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

### Blog

* **Image translation papers**

In this [blog](https://jiaojiaoye1994.github.io/jiaojiaoye.github.com/posts/paper/img_translation_paper), I summarize some recent papers from CVPR. ECCV related to topic image translation.


* **Sequence model**
In this [blog](https://jiaojiaoye1994.github.io/jiaojiaoye.github.com/posts/paper/CVAE_sequence_model_papers), I summarize some papers related to topic Conditional VAE and Human-Robot Interaction,.


### Tutorial
* **CS231n's Assignments** 

I've worked through Stanford's Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu), which is a wonderful lecture for diving into Deep Learning. [Here](https://github.com/JiaojiaoYe1994/cs231_assignment_solution1718) find out my solution for assignments.
